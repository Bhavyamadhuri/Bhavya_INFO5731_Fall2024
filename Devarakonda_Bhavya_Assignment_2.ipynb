The problem then becomes that you cannot actually purchase a plan. The website itself is non-functional and extremely flaky.The website refuses to function in Firefox....ok so I tried a Chromium browser. Ran into issues with a \"promo code\" for the $5 off coupon of auto-renew. Ok, no auto-renew, \"Choose Payment Plan\" button will never become available and is permanently greyed out.Trying to troubleshoot the issue you then run into a message of \"We cannot process your transaction at this time. Please contact customer support by CALLING 1-800-I-don't-have-a-phone.\"Ok, no phone, can't call customer support, so let's try looking for a live-chat or email under \"Contact Us\" or \"Customer Support\".Nope, no way whatsoever for you to contact their customer support department over this issue. Their \"Live Chat\" section even talks about their available times.....with ZERO link to said \"Live Chat\" functionality. I guess they removed that pathway but forgot to remove their text blurb about it under \"Contact Us\"????Anyways, asking new customers to CALL when most people do not have Land-Lines or an additional phone to activate said new phone with is absurd.Tracfone's business is apparently completely non-functional and burning (or already burned?).AVOID THIS PRODUCT, find someone else!Read more\n",
